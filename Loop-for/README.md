# FOR loop - tasks
Using your knowledge from the FOR Loop segment, create the following function:

1. Write a function nOddNumbers, which takes a parameter n. The parameter n will tell our function how many consecutive odd numbers it should print out. For example, calling nOddNumbers(5) will print 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 consecutively on the console. The formula for the next odd number is 2*i - 1.
